# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
This is a project to analyse the employee demographic at Pewlett-Hackard for strategic Human Resource decisions.
## Project Overview
The company has been in existence for a while now and many of the employees are getting close to retirement. The Human Resources department, in a proactive measure would like to see what the existing landscape of the employee demographic at Pewlett-Hackard in order to plan recruitment and retention strategies going forward. The intent is not to be blindsided by a slew of retirements, but to inform the leaders as to what to expect in the future and to equip them to put in place the startegy that would help them continue to resource their departments at the appropriate levels with the required talent.
## The Process
The first step was to obtain the relevant employee files, convert them into tables, identify relationships between them in order to be able to conduct queries and produce the relevant reports that would be required to achieve the purpose of the project.
A total of six files were identified and a schematic of the relationship between them was established as a first step which can be seen here in this diagram:
